Hi!

My name is Ivan Boldyrev, I am software engineer born in Novosibirsk, Russia.  My main areas of interest are functional programming, Rust, and big data/highload.

Since the beginning of 2024 I live in Barcelona, Spain.

My favourite projects are:

  * [StarJs](https://github.com/monoid/starjs) -- astronomical library for JavaScript.
  * [FUCC](https://github.com/monoid/fucc) -- LALR parser generator for Common Lisp.
  * [hdfesse](https://github.com/monoid/hdfesse) -- WIP HDFS library in Rust (originally intended to replace libhdfs).
<!--  * [damietta](https://github.com/monoid/damietta) -- not-even-alpha binary translator project. -->

I am big fan of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and Apple Macbook Air M1.  My other hobbies include studying French language, ink pens, sailing and reading.
